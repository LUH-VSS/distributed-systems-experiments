# distributed-systems-experiments
This repository contains files for experiments for an exercise intended to get you acquainted to the world of Distributed Systems.

To see the purpose of the exercise, consult the [Exercise PDF document](https://github.com/LUH-VSS/distributed-systems-experiments/blob/main/Distributed_Systems_Exercise_23.pdf).



## Instructions Track 1
```
$ git clone https://github.com/LUH-VSS/distributed-systems-experiments.git
$ cd distributed-systems-experiments
$ cd track_1
$ ls
1_customer_trends.txt
2_customer_trends.txt
3_customer_trends.txt
...
```
We provide 10 files to get you started with a proof of concept. However, if you want to conduct experiment with more data, you can create similar data using the script we used for generating the files in the first place. To generate new data, you can use the `track_1/generate_trends.py` script.

## Instructions Track 2
```
$ git clone https://github.com/LUH-VSS/distributed-systems-experiments.git
$ cd distributed-systems-experiments
$ cd track_2
$ ls
1_bank_customers.txt
2_bank_customers.txt
3_bank_customers.txt
...
```
We provide 10 files to get you started with a proof of concept. However, if you want to conduct experiment with more data, you can create similar data using the script we used for generating the files in the first place. To generate new data, you can use the `track_2/generate_customers.py` script.
